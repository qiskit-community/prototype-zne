class LocalFoldingAmplifier(FoldingAmplifier):
    """
    Replaces gates in the circuit by said gate and its inverse alternatingly as many times as
    indicated by noise_factor. The gates that should be folded can be specified by
    ``gates_to_fold``. By default, all gates of the circuit are folded.

    If ``noise_factor`` is not an odd integer, a subset of gates of the full circule are sub-folded
    such that the resultant noise scaling :math:`\\lambda` equals :math:`\\lambda=(2n+1)+2s/d`,
    where :math:`d` are the number of layers of the original circuit, :math:`n` is the number of
    gate foldings, and :math:`s` is the number of gates that are sub-folded [1].

    The gates of the full circuit that are sub-folded can be the first :math:`s` gates, the last
    :math:`s` gates or a random selection of :math:`s` gates. This is specified by
    ``sub_folding_option``.

    Note that all instance objects and their attributes are immutable by construction. If another
    strategy with different options needs to be utilized, a new instance of the class should be
    created.
