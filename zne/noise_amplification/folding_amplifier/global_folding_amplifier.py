class GlobalFoldingAmplifier(FoldingAmplifier):
    """Alternatingly composes the circuit and its inverse as many times as indicated by the
    ``noise_factor``.

    If ``noise_factor`` is not an odd integer, a sub part of the full circle is folded such that the
    resultant noise scaling :math:`\\lambda` equals :math:`\\lambda=(2n+1)+2s/d`, where :math:`d`
    are the number of layers of the original circuit, :math:`n` is the number of global circuit
    foldings, and :math:`s` is the number of gates that are sub-folded [1].

    The gates of the full circuit that are used for the sub-folding can be the first :math:`s`
    gates, the last :math:`s` gates or a random selection of :math:`s` gates. This is specified by
    ``sub_folding_option``.

    Note that all instance objects and their attributes are immutable by construction. If another
    strategy with different options needs to be utilized, a new instance of the class should be
    created.
